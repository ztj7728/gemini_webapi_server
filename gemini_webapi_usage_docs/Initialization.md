### Initialization

Import required packages and initialize a client with your cookies obtained from the previous step. After a successful initialization, the API will automatically refresh `__Secure-1PSIDTS` in background as long as the process is alive.

```python
import asyncio
from gemini_webapi import GeminiClient

# Replace "COOKIE VALUE HERE" with your actual cookie values.
# Leave Secure_1PSIDTS empty if it's not available for your account.
Secure_1PSID = "COOKIE VALUE HERE"
Secure_1PSIDTS = "COOKIE VALUE HERE"

async def main():
    # If browser-cookie3 is installed, simply use `client = GeminiClient()`
    client = GeminiClient(Secure_1PSID, Secure_1PSIDTS, proxy=None)
    await client.init(timeout=30, auto_close=False, close_delay=300, auto_refresh=True)

asyncio.run(main())
```

> [!TIP]
>
> `auto_close` and `close_delay` are optional arguments for automatically closing the client after a certain period of inactivity. This feature is disabled by default. In an always-on service like chatbot, it's recommended to set `auto_close` to `True` combined with reasonable seconds of `close_delay` for better resource management.
