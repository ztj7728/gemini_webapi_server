### Generate contents from text

Ask a one-turn quick question by calling `GeminiClient.generate_content`.

```python
async def main():
    response = await client.generate_content("Hello World!")
    print(response.text)

asyncio.run(main())
```

>
> Simply use `print(response)` to get the same output if you just want to see the response text
